FEEDBACK:

Well done in converting your implementation to a generic data structure!


Good use of a for-each loop to print the elements of your linked list.


Good testing of your implementation. 


other comments:
Nice use of TODO list for improvements. 
   Please clarify what "keep subscription list organized by year" means?
   This seems to imply you would prefer a key, value pair data structure 
   such as a HashMap.
